## Profile

I'm an IT engineer who's passionate about setting up dev environments and building web tools in my spare time.  
I'm also the supreme leader of the Okayama Iced Coffee Club — because let's be real, iced coffee is the ultimate drink! ☕️  
I'm a firm believer in "multi-standardism" — basically, I think there are as many different versions of "normal," "common sense," and "obvious" as there are people in this world. Everyone's got their own take on what's standard, and that's totally cool with me!

- 💡 **Philosophy**: Creating sustainable value through IT
- 🖼️ **Vision**: Solving core problems with optimal technology
- 📍 **Positioning**: Full-Cycle Engineer tackling business challenges with IT & AI

<summary style="font-weight:700">What is a Full-Cycle Engineer?</summary>

A development approach advocated by Netflix in 2018 where engineers handle the entire software lifecycle:  
Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Operation → Support

**Full-Cycle (depth of development process), not Full-Stack (breadth of technical domains)**

Reference: [Netflix Technology Blog (2018)](https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249)

**Practical Example**:
- **Fast logbook PWA**: Handled everything from planning → PWA/i18n learning → implementation → OSS release & Netlify deployment → user support
